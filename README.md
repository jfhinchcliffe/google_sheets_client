# 📝💎 google_sheets_client (wip)

## Intended to interface with Google Sheets via GQL

### Steps to Run
* Download the repo
* `docker-compose up`
* Profit! 💰

### Notes
- You may have to shell in to the app and `rm Gemfile.lock` and `bundle`. Or I have when I've set this up on a different computer.
- Because I always forget, `docker-compose run --rm app sh` gets you a shell in the app
